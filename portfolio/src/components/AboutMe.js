            My name is Lori Ross and I am a 20+ year financial professional with a concentration in Accounts Receivable. I have been in my current role as Supplier Receivables Manager at McKesson Corporation for the past 3 years. I manage a team of 3 locl analysts and 6 virtual analysts that are located in New Dehli India. I was with the opportunity to travel to India to train and onboard the virtual team approximately two years ago. I am currently enrolled in SMU's Coding Bootcamp. I am excited to put my new skills to use to build applications and tools to help automate and create efficiencies in my current role. I am also looking for opportunities to freelance and expand my skillset through independent projects.   </p>
